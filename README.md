# WorldBuildingGenerator

## Creates a short description for what your characters see and what they could interact with.

This short project looks at how to use a Context-Free language to generate prompts for further exploration. \
There are a few limits of this. The structure is very formulaic with a predictable structure. However, due to the vast possible number of outputs due to the combination of adjectives, objects and verbs, there are thousands of possible prompts.
